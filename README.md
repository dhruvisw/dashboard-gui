# Smart-Dashboard-gui
The evolution of business dashboards can be traced back four decades. In the early 1970s, businesses were using decision support systems (DSS) to perform business intelligence tasks. 
They were originally modeled from automobile dashboards, which provide the status of critical functions, like gasoline levels or speed, to drivers.
Fast-forward to the business intelligence dashboards that are available today: dashboard visualization has become an industry standard that is widely adopted by analytics professionals, students, and directors of global organizations.
Companies need to make informed decisions quickly. Thatâ€™s where business dashboards can help. In addition, they integrate business information across the enterprise to improve workflow management across business functions.

Here I have created a Tkinter GUI that creates a dashboard containing three different graphs from a file uploaded by the user locally.
